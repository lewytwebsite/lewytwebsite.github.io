            <h3><i> Biography of Alexander and Elisabeth Lewyt </i> </h3>
            <hr>
            <p class = "opening"> Alexander Lewyt (1908 - 1988) was a visionary, inventor and entrepreneur. Elisabeth "Babette" Lewyt championed organizations that followed a no-kill policy for stray and abandoned pets. Together, the Lewyts were instrumental in saving countless animals from euthanasia, both through philanthropy and hands on work.
            </p>
            <p>

            Mr. Lewyt held patents for scores of inventions, but he was best known for the Lewyt vacuum 
            cleaner, a compact machine with no dust bag that was designed to operate without distorting 
            television and radio reception.  For the last 30 years of his life, he was president of the North 
            Shore Animal League and was credited with restoring it to solvency and turning it into one of the 
            largest animal shelters in the country.  Having served on the board of directors of a number of 
            philanthropic enterprises, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Mr. Lewyt often said he 
            channeled his considerable energies into the North Shore Animal League because “my wife 
            adores animals, and I adore my wife.” <br><br>
            Elisabeth Lewyt (1913 - 2012) championed organizations that followed a no-kill policy for strays 
            and abandoned pets.  Elisabeth Roulleau was born in 1913 in Chartres, France, near the city 
            cathedral, and immigrated to the United States in 1936, later becoming a naturalized American 
            citizen.  She married Alexander Lewyt in 1953 in New York City.  <br><br>
            Known to her friends as Babette, Mrs. Lewyt was instrumental in rescuing countless animals 
            from euthanasia, personally driving her van all over the roads of Long Island to visit shelters and 
            rescue as many dogs and cats as she could.  Having inspired countless others to give time and 
            money to the cause, Mrs. Lewyt also served as chairperson of the board for the North Shore 
            Animal League until her death. </p>

            <hr>
            <p class = "opening"> After her passing in 2012, Mrs. Lewyt left the bulk of her and her husband’s fortune to the newly created Alex & Elisabeth Lewyt Wholly Charitable Trust, to carry on their philanthropy

            programs that are consistent with its mission through grants and other initiatives.</p>
